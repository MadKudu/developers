# Introduction

Welcome to the MadKudu API.

- All requests should be made using *https://*.
- All response bodies, including errors are encoded in JSON.

We have official language bindings in:

- [Node.js](https://github.com/MadKudu/madkudu-node)

You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Authentication

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://api.madkudu.com/v1/ping" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic QUJDRDEyMzQ6"
# Make sure to replace `QUJDRDEyMzQ6` with the correct value.
```

```javascript
const madkudu = require('@madkudu/madkudu-node')('your_api_key');
```

The MadKudu API uses HTTP Basic Auth and requires using HTTPS on all API calls.

Your API Key should be used as the basic auth username. You do not need to provide a password.

For example, if your userâ€™s API key was `ABCD1234`, you need to Base64 encode the string `ABCD1234:` (Please note the colon at the end) and prepend the string `Basic ``. In this case, this would result in a final header of:

`Authorization: Basic QUJDRDEyMzQ6`

<aside class="notice">
The rest of this documentation assumes that you pass the authorization header with every call
</aside>

# Demographics API

## Companies

Our Company API lets you lookup a company profile via a domain name. It returns the predictive customer fit of the company (aka. demographics score), the top signals behind this score (ie. why is this company a good fit or not), and some light demographics information (eg. number of employees, industry, etc.).

```shell
curl "https://api.madkudu.com/v1/companies?domain=madkudu.com" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic QUJDRDEyMzQ6"
```

```javascript
madkudu.company.find({ domain: 'madkudu.com' })
    .then(function (company) {
        console.log(company);
    });
});
```

```json

# Models API
Our Models API takes the model ID, and either returns the configuration value or make changes to the model configuration. It is a good method to manage MadKudu's different prediction models in a way that would help sales and marketing teams increase conversions.

## List Models
You can obtain a list of available models that have already been set up on the platform, and its configuration. To use the Models API, simply input the right request.

## Get a Model Definition
Sometimes you'll want to look up the configuration value of a specific Topical Scorer model that you've created and saved. The Models API returns the details of the model configuration such as topics, keywords and weights, settings for confidence_mapping as well as your tenant key that the model is saved in, model ID and the timestamp at which it is created and updated.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.madkudu.com/v1/models/:id`

### Query Parameters
The following parameters are supported.

Parameter | Type
--------- | -----
id | **string (required)**
name | **string (optional)**

## Configure a New Model
To create a new Topical Scorer model, use POST with the configurations made from platform itself so send us the parameters that should be included in the configuration such as name, topics and confidence_mapping in the request body.

For each topic created, you can input different keywords with weights. In this case, weight directly impacts the importance of the keyword in the model. If the keyword appears on the lead's website page two times, that will be counted as two "hits". We will then calculate the weighted score for each topic based on: keywords_n(number of hits x weight). Then, we will compute the overall score for each topic based on: sum of weighted scores for each keyword. This score will be mapped to confidence using the settings you configured in confidence_mapping. Confidence ranges from 0 to 100.

# Predictions API
The Predictions API takes a model ID and provides predictive recommendations according to the model type.

## Obtain Predictions for a Stored Model
To obtain predictions of a stored model for a specific domain, send us the id, domain and type in the request body. The default response will only show confidence. However, you can choose to see both confidence and score by adding "show_scores: true" in the request body.

```json
{
    "main_topic": {
        "name": "e-commerce",
        "confidence": 7
    },
    "topics": [
        {
            "name": "e-commerce",
            "confidence": 7,
            "hits": [
                {
                    "phrase": "online",
                    "count": 1
                },
                {
                    "phrase": "delivery",
                    "count": 2
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "physical_store",

        }

## Obtain On-the-Fly Predictions
The common use case here is when creating a new Topical Scorer model, you may sometimes need to be able to get results on the fly while creating the model. For this, you do not have to send us the model ID. You simply have to include the model configuration, domain and type. Again, you can choose to see both confidence and score by adding "show_scores: true" in the request body.

### HTTP Request

`POST https://api.madkudu.com/v1/predictions`

### Query Parameters
The following parameters are supported.

```
{
    "email": "jane.killian@oracle.com",
    "domain": "oracle.com",
    "company": {},
