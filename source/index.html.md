# Introduction

Welcome to the MadKudu API.

- All requests should be made using *https://*.
- All response bodies, including errors are encoded in JSON.

We have official language bindings in:

- [Node.js](https://github.com/MadKudu/madkudu-node)

You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Authentication

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://api.madkudu.com/v1/ping" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic QUJDRDEyMzQ6"
# Make sure to replace `QUJDRDEyMzQ6` with the correct value.
```

```javascript
var madkudu = require('@madkudu/madkudu-node')('your_api_key');
```

The MadKudu API uses HTTP Basic Auth and requires using HTTPS on all API calls.

Your API Key should be used as the basic auth username. You do not need to provide a password.

For example, if your userâ€™s API key was `ABCD1234`, you need to Base64 encode the string `ABCD1234:` (Please note the colon at the end) and prepend the string `Basic ``. In this case, this would result in a final header of:

`Authorization: Basic QUJDRDEyMzQ6`

<aside class="notice">
The rest of this documentation assumes that you pass the authorization header with every call
