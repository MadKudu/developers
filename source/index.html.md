# Introduction

Welcome to the MadKudu API.

- All requests should be made using *https://*.
- All response bodies, including errors are encoded in JSON.

We have official language bindings in:

- [Node.js](https://github.com/MadKudu/madkudu-node)

You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Authentication

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://api.madkudu.com/v1/ping" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic QUJDRDEyMzQ6"
# Make sure to replace `QUJDRDEyMzQ6` with the correct value.
```

```javascript
const madkudu = require('@madkudu/madkudu-node')('your_api_key');
```

The MadKudu API uses HTTP Basic Auth and requires using HTTPS on all API calls.

Your API Key should be used as the basic auth username. You do not need to provide a password.

For example, if your userâ€™s API key was `ABCD1234`, you need to Base64 encode the string `ABCD1234:` (Please note the colon at the end) and prepend the string `Basic ``. In this case, this would result in a final header of:

`Authorization: Basic QUJDRDEyMzQ6`

<aside class="notice">
The rest of this documentation assumes that you pass the authorization header with every call
</aside>

# Demographics API

## Companies

Our Company API lets you lookup a company profile via a domain name. It returns the predictive customer fit of the company (aka. demographics score), the top signals behind this score (ie. why is this company a good fit or not), and some light demographics information (eg. number of employees, industry, etc.).

```shell
curl "https://api.madkudu.com/v1/companies?domain=madkudu.com" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic QUJDRDEyMzQ6"
```

```javascript
madkudu.company.find({ domain: 'madkudu.com' })
    .then(function (company) {
        console.log(company);
    });
});
```

# Models API
Our Models API takes the model ID, and either returns the configuration value or make changes to the model configuration. It is a good method to manage MadKudu's different prediction models in a way that would help sales and marketing teams increase conversions.

### Model Lookup
You can obtain a list of available models that have already been set up on the platform. To use the Models API, simply input the right request.

```shell
Key in your MadKudu API key under Authorization:

curl "https://api.madkudu.com/v1/models" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic QUJDRDEyMzQ6"
```
```json
{
  "results": {
      "models": [
          {
              "id": "123456",
              "Name": "find_industry",
              "type": "topical"
          },
          {
              "id": "143265",
              "name": "find_use_case",
              "type": "topical"
          }
      ]
  }
}
```

#### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.madkudu.com/v1/models`

#### Query Parameters
The following parameters are supported.

Parameter | Type
--------- | -----
id | **string (optional)**
name | **string (optional)**

## Topical Scorer Model
The Models API for Topical Scorer model lets you  extract insightful information from web properties of your leads. It returns the main topic most relevant to your leads with its prediction scores against your core use cases, industries and qualified needs.

### Configuration View
Sometimes you'll want to look up the configuration value of a specific Topical Scorer model directly through the API because you are making edits on the fly. The Models API returns the details of the model configuration such as topics, keywords and weights.

```json
{
    "id": "123",
    "name": "find_industry",
    "topics": [{
        "topic": "is_retailer",
        "keywords": [{
            "phrase": "store",
            "weight": 0.25
        }, {
            "phrase": "stores",
            "weight": 0.25
        }]
     }, {
        "topic": "is_restaurant",
        "keywords": [{
            "phrase": "menu",
            "weight": 1
        }, {
            "phrase": "nutrition",
            "weight": 1
        }]
    }]
}
```
#### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.madkudu.com/v1/models/:id`

#### Query Parameters
The following parameters are supported.

Parameter | Type
--------- | -----
id | **string (required)**
name | **string (optional)**

### Configuration of Model
To create a new Topical Scorer model, use POST with the configurations made from platform itself so send us the parameters that should be included in the configuration such as name and topics in the request body.

For each topic created, you can input different keywords with weights. In this case, weight directly impacts the importance of the keyword in the model. If the keyword appears on the lead's website page two times, that will be counted as two "hits". We will then calculate the weighted score for each topic based on: keywords_n(number of hits x weight). Then, we will then compute the overall score for each topic based on: sum of weighted scores for each keyword.

```json
{
    "id": "123",
    "name": "find_industry",
    "topics": [{
        "topic": "is_retailer",
        "keywords": [{
            "phrase": "store",
            "weight": 0.25
        }, {
            "phrase": "stores",
            "weight": 0.25
        }]
     }, {
        "topic": "is_restaurant",
        "keywords": [{
            "phrase": "menu",
            "weight": 1
        }, {
            "phrase": "nutrition",
            "weight": 1
        }]
    }]
}
```
#### HTTP Request

`POST https://api.madkudu.com/v1/models/`

#### Query Parameters
The following parameters are supported.

Parameter | Type
--------- | -----
name | **string (optional)**
topics | **string (optional)**

### Model Update
Sometimes you'll need to update your model with more relevant keywords or accurate weightage allocation. This update will be done on a specific model. Simply send us the model id and it will directly update the model with user-specified configurations.

#### HTTP Request

`POST https://api.madkudu.com/v1/models/:id`

#### Query Parameters
The following parameters are supported.

Parameter | Type
--------- | -----
id | **string (required)**

# Predictions API
The Predictions API takes a model id and provides predictive recommendations according to the model type.

## Topical Scorer Model
The Predictions API for Topical Scorer models takes a model id and domain name, and returns the topics found on the lead's website with the scores from highest to lowest. This is especially useful for de-anomyzing traffic on your website and customizing outreach efforts.

### Predictions of Stored Model
To obtain predictions of a stored model for a specific domain, send us the id and the domain in request body.

```json
{
    "domain": "patagonia.com.au",
    "topics": [
        {
            "name": "has_store",
            "hits": [
                {
                    "phrase": "store",
                    "hits": 5,
                    "weighted_score": 1.25
                },
                {
                    "phrase": "branch",
                    "hits": 1,
                    "weighted_score": 1
                },
            ],

  -X POST \
  -d '{"email": "elon@tesla.com"}'
```

> The API response will look like this:

```json
{
  "predictions": {
    "customer_fit": {
      "segment": "very good"
    }
  }
}
```

> where segment can be "low", "medium", "good", "very good" or "not enough information"

Returns the prediction results for a given email / domain
